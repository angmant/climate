# Global temperature, Carbon dioxide and Glaciers mass correlations
what is this about?
Do CO2 emissions correlate with the rise of Global Temperature? Is there a correlation between
Global Temperature and Glaciers mass? Using data series on atmospheric carbon dioxide, global
temperatures and Glaciers mass, we investigate the relation between these for the period 1900-2017
